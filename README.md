# RareTrackerWorldBosses (RTWB)
**RareTrackerDragonflight (RTD)** is an addon that allows users to track and share rare spawn timers for rares added in the Dragonflight expansion. The addon takes inspiration from the [RareCoordinator](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/rarecoordinator) addon authored by [elvador](https://www.curseforge.com/members/elvador/followers), which is an addon that has served a similar purpose on the Timeless Isle. RareTrackerDragonflight uses a hidden chat channel to communicate with other clients located in the same shard, such that it can always provide the most up-to-date rare spawn timers. Please look at the [RareTrackerCore (RT)](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/raretrackercore-rt) core addon for instructions on how to use the addon.
